## **Introduction**  

Ensuring home security and safety is crucial, and this system is designed to monitor electrical devices using a current sensor. It detects abnormalities in real time and alerts users, helping to prevent potential hazards. By integrating machine learning, the system enables real-time analysis, classification, and anomaly detection based on electrical signal patterns.  

To enhance efficiency, this project utilizes **NanoEdge AI**, an advanced edge AI technology optimized for embedded devices. NanoEdge AI allows adaptive learning and anomaly detection for audio signals without relying on cloud-based processing, making the system faster and more reliable.  

## **Existing Methods & Challenges**  

Several conventional methods exist for monitoring electrical devices, each with its own limitations. **Threshold-based systems** are simple but ineffective for fluctuating power patterns, often leading to false positives or missed faults. **Signal processing techniques**, such as FFT and wavelet analysis, can detect anomalies but require high computational power and lack adaptability to dynamic environments. **Traditional machine learning models**, while useful, demand extensive labeled data for training and often struggle to identify previously unseen faults.  

By addressing these challenges, this system provides a more efficient and adaptive approach to real-time current monitoring and anomaly detection, ensuring improved safety and reliability.
